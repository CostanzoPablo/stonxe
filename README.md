## Original conditions
* What is published cannot be edited or deleted.
* The person posting must have a valid account (onboarding).

## Afterthoughts
* To validate accounts, in addition to onboarding, it could be validated by credit card.

## Problems
* Those who use Twitter use it for anonymity.

## Possible solutions
* It offers a 10-pack for $1.10 per month. This allows you to follow 10 people, with each person following earning 10 cents, and the platform earning 10 cents for the infrastructure/business.
* Create the concept of angels and demons. Demons that don't require onboarding and can pay with crypto. A demon's post will have replies from other demons first, and vice versa.

## Infrastructure
* Fast API + Cassandra
* Model the tables messages by country and by person (duplicate)
