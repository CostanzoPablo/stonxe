* Create the concept of angels and demons. Demons that don't require onboarding and can pay with crypto. A demon's post will have replies from other demons first, and vice versa.
* 3 views, to filter by light blue, purple, or red, to see only messages from angels, mixed, or demons. (background bar gradient).
* Messages with stars. 1 star is public, 2 stars are sensitive content, and 3 stars are for police.
* Add screenshot from shared links.
* Allow add answers before confirm send message (with counter 10'' allowing cancel), to create a thread.
